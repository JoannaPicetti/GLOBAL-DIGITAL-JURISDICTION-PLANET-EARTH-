# Global-Digital-Jurisdiction-of-Planet-Earth-


# VISION OF THE PROJECT:

PLANET EARTH DIGITAL JURISDICTION (Blockchain of entire Planet Earth)


INTERPLANETARY ID SYSTEM  - Planet Earth NFT Passports

Proof of Personhood ---> Directly built it by POP


# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:


I built a new Blockchain for a Global Planet Earth Digital Jurisdiction --> Proof of Personhood.

I build a new Wallet ID -  Planet Earth Identity Wallet â€”> Global NFT Passports (Storage on IPFS) (PRIVACY MATTERS - Zero Knowledge Proof)

I built a Web Browser extension of the wallet and Mobile app to allow people to interact on the new Blockchain Global Digital Jurisdiction of Planet Earth.

PoS is inherently a plutocracy that makes the rich richer. I prefer democracy. Digital Democracy. Because of that the blockchain built it with POP.

Blockchain has no personhood, so you can't have 1 person = 1 vote. You can have 1 unit of money = 1 vote, which is plutocracy, not democracy.

Blockchain just blindly executes rules. The rules (that are effectively a monetary policy) are still written and approved by people, but these people aren't elected officials, but an oligarchy of developers and plutocracy of miners. And with Proof of Stake, the same happens with validators. POS is terrible. 

Anybody who has capital to do so<< can turn that capital into influence (through staking or mining). That is the definition of plutocracy. If it wasn't anyone, we'd be talking about aristocracy, etc.


Blockchain is the best invention ever since the internet. (It has existed for 13 years). But none built it with POP.


Some core use cases of Blockchain of Planet Earth:

- Land registry
- Transparent gov spending
- Automated taxation
- UBI
