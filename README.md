ETHereum is becoming Proof of Stake

Comments --> 

Proof of Stake is inherently a plutocracy that makes the rich richer. We prefer democracy. Digital Democracy. 

Blockchain has NO personhood, so you can't have 1 person = 1 vote. You can have 1 unit of money = 1 vote, which is plutocracy, not democracy.

Blockchain just blindly executes rules. The rules (that are effectively a monetary policy) are still written and approved by people, but these people aren't elected officials, but an oligarchy of developers and plutocracy of miners. And with Proof of Stake, the same happens with validators. POS is terrible. 

Anybody who has capital to do so<< can turn that capital into influence (through staking or mining). That is the definition of plutocracy. If it wasn't anyone, we'd be talking about aristocracy, etc.


Blockchain is the best invention ever since the internet. (It has existed for 13 years) --> I built the first whole PLANET EARTH blockchain.

All people, companies and Nations States in the same ledger.

3 differents mechanism of Blockchain:

Proof of Person
Proof of Nation DAO
Proof of Company DAO

Private Sector + Public Sector + Civil Society

All of them into the PLANET EARTH DAO

Some core use cases of Blockchain of Planet Earth:

- Land registry
- Transparent gov spending
- Automated taxation
- UBI
